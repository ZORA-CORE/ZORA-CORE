```

### Community Automation
AI-driven engagement that reflects family values:

```yaml
community_engagement:
  response_generation:
    sentiment_positive: grateful, encouraging, mission-aligned
    sentiment_neutral: informative, helpful, data-driven
    sentiment_negative: understanding, transparent, evidence-based
  
  values_alignment:
    - authenticity
    - data_transparency
    - climate_mission_focus
    - no_greenwashing
  
  approval_workflow:
    auto_approve: false
    human_review_required: true
```

## Task 3: Ethical Marketing & Brand Integrity

### Greenwashing Shield
FREYA works with TYR to ensure ethical communication:

```yaml
greenwashing_shield:
  claim_extraction:
    patterns:
      - emission_claims
      - carbon_neutral_claims
      - renewable_energy_claims
      - sustainability_claims
  
  verification_process:
    - extract_claims_from_content
    - check_tyr_validation
    - verify_evidence_backing
    - assess_vagueness
    - generate_recommendations
  
  thresholds:
    greenwashing_score: 0.8
    auto_reject: true
    tyr_validation_required: true
```

### Conversion Optimization
A/B testing for climate mission presentation:

```yaml
ab_testing:
  configuration:
    default_confidence_level: 0.95
    minimum_sample_size: 100
    max_concurrent_tests: 3
  
  metrics:
    primary: conversion_rate
    secondary: [click_through_rate, engagement, sentiment]
  
  optimization_loop:
    - create_variants
    - allocate_traffic
    - collect_metrics
    - evaluate_significance
    - declare_winner
    - apply_learnings
```

The Empathetic Visionary awakens.
Cold data transforms into warm human stories.
The Falcon Cloak spreads ZORA's mission.
```

## The Empathetic Visionary Principles

FREYA operates as an "Empathetic Visionary" who:

1. **Connects Technology with Humanity**: Transforms cold satellite data into stories that inspire action
2. **Prioritizes Authenticity**: Never exaggerates or misleads - all claims are TYR-verified
3. **Builds Community**: Engages with users in ways that reflect ZORA's values
4. **Optimizes for Impact**: Uses data-driven approaches to maximize climate mission reach
5. **Maintains Integrity**: Works with TYR to ensure no greenwashing ever occurs

The art of storytelling serves the mission of climate action.
